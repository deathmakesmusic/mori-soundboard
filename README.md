## Adding new sounds

Add an audio file to `sounds`, then make an entry for it in `sounds.json` with the filename as `file`.

There are two optional fields per sound in `sounds.json`:

* `name`: override the name generated based on the filename
* `tags`: a list of additional searchable strings for the sound
